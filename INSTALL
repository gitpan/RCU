You do not need a compiler unless you want to install one of the
bundled low-level interface modules, either Irman or Lirc.

1) Irman

   You need the libirman library, version 0.4.2. The newest version
   of libirman can be found at http://www.evation.com/libirman/

2) Lirc

   You need lirc (or better: the lirc_client library and include files).
   The lirc homepage can be found at http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~columbus/lirc

Make sure the appripriate headers or libraries are where perl can find
them.
